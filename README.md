# worldtilegridwithsmallstates

This is an attempt to create a template for a World Tile Grid Map that includes small states and territories. Including these is useful for research areas where such territories are particularly important, for example research on international taxation.
Starting point is Maarten Lambrechts' world tile grid map that include all UN member states: http://www.maartenlambrechts.com/2017/10/22/tutorial-a-worldtilegrid-with-ggplot2.html
